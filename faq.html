            <h1>FAQ</h1>
            <h3>Do you accept transfers?</h3>
            <p>No. Everyone who joins our Army must start at the rank of Private.</p>
            <h3>How do you win rares?</h3>
            <p>Rares are given away at random times in HQ to active personnel ranked Specialist and higher. Winners are
                determined via holodice/a random number generator. Reaching the rank of Specialist can typically be
                achieved in 2-3 days if you are active and putting in effort in HQ.</p>
            <h3>What is VIP status?</h3>
            <p>VIP status can be purchased by civilians who are not active personnel in our military. VIPs are permitted
                to sit in the area with Throne Sofas, alongside Officers and the Cabinet (Secretaries).

                VIPs can enter the Officer seating area through the Sentry in HQ.

                VIPs cannot provide orders to, or promote, any of our personnel.

                VIPs cannot join our Army unless they give up their VIP status before completing Basic Training.
            </p>
            <h3>How much is VIP?</h3>
            <p>The cost to gain Room Rights in our VIP Entrance room is 2 HC Sofas, or the equivalent value in
                catalogue-released rares.

                All rares received will be used towards our giveaways to active personnel in HQ. Our Army does not
                operate on a for-profit basis, so we appreciate your support!

                Please contact our General, iPod, if you are interested in purchasing VIP status.

                Very close friends of our Army might receive VIP status (potentially including room rights within HQ)
                for free.</p>
