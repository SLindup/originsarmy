                <h3>What is a Habbo army?</h3>
                <p>Unlike many other games, Habbo Hotel: Origins lacks the ability to level up, complete quests, and so
                    forth. To compensate for this, our army offers a variety of tasks and objectives. You can rise up our
                    more than 20 ranks, which are displayed in your Mission. You can chat with new friends in HQ, recruit
                    new members, join departments, give and receive trainings, participate in weekly meetings, attend our
                    private events and games with prizes, win rares in our daily giveaways, and more!</p>

                <h3>How do you win rares?</h3>
                <p>We aim to give away at least one rare per day. At random times, an Officer or Sergeant Major of the Army
                    may announce a giveaway in HQ. All personnel who are present in the room at that time will be assigned a
                    number. Next, the Officer or Sergeant Major of the Army will roll a Dicemaster or Holodice. If the
                    number rolled matches your number, you win!</p>

                <h3>What is VIP status?</h3>
                <p>Individuals who purchase VIP status are permitted to sit in the area with Throne Sofas, alongside Officers. You cannot be a VIP if you are enlisted in our Army.</p>
                <p>Very trusted VIPs may receive room rights.</p>

                <h3>How much is VIP status?</h3>
                <p>3 rares. </p>
                <p>All rares received will be used towards our daily giveaways.</p>
